## What is TAGiT?

**Click when it clicks.**

TAGiT is a **Chrome extension and web app** that lets users tag, annotate, and organize moments in YouTube videos, turning them into structured knowledge with AI summaries and flashcards.

### The Problem
Video content is everywhere, but learning from videos is passive and forgettable. Important insights are lost in hours of content.

### The Solution
TAGiT transforms video watching into active knowledge building by letting you:
- Tag moments as you watch
- Get AI-generated summaries instantly
- Build a searchable personal knowledge base
- Review with AI-generated flashcards

---

### 2. Watch YouTube
Browse and watch videos as you normally would.

### 3. Tag Important Moments
When you hear something important, press:
- **Alt+T** (Windows/Linux)
- **Opt+T** (Mac)

Or click the extension icon.

### 4. AI Processes the Tag
TAGiT automatically:
- Extracts the transcript (±15 seconds around the moment)
- Generates an AI summary of key concepts
- Creates flashcards for active recall
- Saves everything to your personal knowledge base

### 5. Review & Learn
Access your tags in the dashboard to:
- Search across all your tagged content
