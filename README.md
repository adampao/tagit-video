# TAGiT - Remember Everything You Watch on YouTube

**You forget 90% of what you watch within a week. TAGiT changes that.**

TAGiT is an AI-powered Chrome extension and PWA dashboard that transforms YouTube videos into lasting knowledge. Using memory science (active recall, spaced repetition, AI summaries), TAGiT helps students, professionals, and lifelong learners retain what they watch - not just save it.

## The Problem

You watch hours of educational YouTube content - tutorials, courses, talks, documentaries. You even take notes. But a week later? You've forgotten most of it.

Research shows we forget 70-90% of new information within 24 hours (Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve). Traditional solutions fail:
- Pausing to take notes breaks your flow
- Saving videos creates a graveyard you never revisit
- Passive watching = minimal retention

TAGiT solves this with science-backed memory techniques, automated by AI.

## Core Features

### Daily Digest
Receive personalized AI-powered insights from all videos you've watched - automatically. Every day, TAGiT analyzes your viewing history, generates concise summaries with actionable takeaways, and delivers them to your inbox. Zero effort required.

**Free:** 3 digests/day | **Pro:** Unlimited

### One-Click Tagging
Capture key moments while watching with a single click (keyboard shortcut: Alt+T / Opt+T). TAGiT automatically extracts timestamped transcripts and generates AI summaries. No flow interruption, no manual note-taking.

### AI-Powered Insights
Context-aware summaries powered by OpenAI's GPT-5 mini. Choose verbosity level (short/medium/long) to match your learning style. TAGiT understands video context and generates relevant, actionable insights.

### Smart Flashcards with Spaced Repetition
Generate flashcards from any tag, then master them using science-backed spaced repetition. Cards progress through learning stages (New → Learning → Review → Mastered) with optimized intervals based on your recall performance.

**Features:**
- AI-generated flashcard categories (Technology, Science, Business, etc.)
- Custom study collections (organize by topic, course, or project)
- Flashcard due notifications (never miss a review)
- Easy/Good/Hard rating system for adaptive learning

**Free:** 25 flashcards/month | **Pro:** Unlimited

### Chat with Video
Ask questions about any video content and get AI-powered answers grounded in the transcript. Perfect for clarifying complex concepts, finding specific moments, or deepening your understanding.

### Cross-Device Sync
All your tags, flashcards, and digests sync instantly across devices via cloud. Start on desktop, review on mobile, study anywhere.

### Export Everything
Export your knowledge base in PDF or Markdown format. Your data is yours - take it anywhere.
